                <p>I spent way too long putting off completing my education. The problem was, I could never figure out for sure
                    what it was I wanted to do. Finally, I looked back and realized I had consistently made websites at each
                    job I've had, just for the fun of it. At long last I realized web dev, is not only a profession that
                    is on the rise, but it is one I am truly drawn to.</p>
                <p> I did my research and landed on what I consider to be the best web dev bootcamp in my area. It was a lot
                    of hard work, but I loved every minute. I studied day and night, 100% dedicated to learning this craft.
                    Since then my love for creating websites has not waivered. I enjoy many hobbies: reading and writing
                    horror, researching history, hiking, playing guitar, but nothing seems to ever beat the thrill of launching
                    some good, clean code!</p>
